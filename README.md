# Beep-Four
An open source DOS game written in Quick Basic 4.5. Yes, it can be done!

Codenamed Beep-Four (or BEEP4) but the name of the engine used in the game is Keen Game Engine 4, or KGE4, which was originally intended as a clone of ID Software's Commander Keen 4.

The engine for this game was programmed from the ground up in QB45 utilizing the excellent DirectQB library. Of course it does have limitations, but these are ALL due to QB's crappy math and logic routines, which are very slow. The graphics routines are blazing fast; if you cut out the math and logic and just run the graphics, you get more than twice the fps. Unfortunately I have everything as optimized as it's going to get. Oh well.

This game properly belongs on 286/386 machines. However, it won't run at the required 24fps on anything short of a DX4/100, which means all you 286 and 386 people out there are out of luck. Most people will just run it in DOSBox, though. Crank it to 60000 cycles (a generous number) and you'll be good.

I've done some checking around, and this may just be about the fastest game ever programmed in QB45.

Currently we're working on the graphics and levels, so be prepared for the day we release this! Hopefully it'll be good.
