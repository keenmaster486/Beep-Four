How to do animations:

1. In tile selection mode, write down the index
   numbers of the tiles you're animating
2. Right click on first tile of animation
3. Now you're in "change tile properties" mode.
   Use the arrow keys to change the tile type
   to "Animated". Now press M to change the
   tile info values manually.
4. There are five (5) tile info values. Here's
   how they're constructed for animated tiles:

   Tile info 1: Number of total animated tiles
   Tile infos 2-5: Index values of remaining tiles
                   (those numbers you wrote down earlier)
                   (Enter 0 for tiles past the number you want)

Example: For a set of three animated tiles (numbers 2114, 2116, 2118),
         you would have the following values:

         Tile index number: 2114
         Tile type: Animated
         Tile info 1: 3 [total number of tiles]
         Tile info 2: 2116
         Tile info 3: 2118
         Tile info 4: 0 [not needed]
         Tile info 5: 0 [not needed]

Example 2: For a set of four animated tiles (numbers 345, 346, 347, 348):

           Tile index number: 345
           Tile type: Animated
           Tile info 1: 4
           Tile info 2: 346
           Tile info 3: 347
           Tile info 4: 348
           Tile info 5: 0 [not needed]

Actually, tile info 5 isn't really used; it's just there for if we might
need it later for something like elevators, maybe.
