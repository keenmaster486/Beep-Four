How to do slopes:

For each tile which Keen will actually stand on (be careful, many of them
he will simply be in front of. Only get the ones he's actually standing
on!), you must do the following:

1. Figure out the following values:
        A. The slope's height above the bottom left corner of the tile
        B. The slope's height above the bottom right corner of the tile

2. Set the tile type to "Slope"
3. Press M to set tile info values manually
4. Set the tile info 1 to value A
5. Set the tile info 2 to value B
