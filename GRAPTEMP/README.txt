In this folder you can add new graphics files (sprites, tilesets, etc.)

Sprites need to be EGA files created with KeenSprite, generally not more than 200x200 pixels. The character sprite, for instance, is usually about 24x32.

Tilesets can be BMP files, not more than 13 tiles wide, which can then be added to the main tileset.

Each tile is 16x16 pixels.
