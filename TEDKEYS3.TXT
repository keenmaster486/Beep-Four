How to do doors ("portals"):

1. Check the tile properties of the BOTTOM TILES of the door
   to make sure they're set to "Portal".
2. Place your two doors, in the MIDGROUND.
3. Write down the coordinates of both bottom tiles of the
   destination door, then add 11000 to each of them.
4. Now we have to use a special function, the "manual foreground tile"
   function. Use the combination "Shift + Left Click" and some text
   will appear at the top of the screen (kind of hard to see) which
   says "Input manual foreground tile value:". Input the x-coordinate
   of the destination door into the left bottom tile, and the y-coordinate
   into the right bottom tile (including the 11000 you added). Some
   numbers should appear there to certify that it actually did it. Do
   this for both doors and you should be good to go!
