Here you can add new levels. They should be created with TED, the level editor in the main directory.

TED expects there to be a full copy of the game engine in its folder, along with the folder LEVELS and all of the level files existing there already.

Alternatively you can enter -1 in the initial "Enter level number" prompt, and it will ask you for a filespec, which should still exist and be placed in the LEVELS directory.
