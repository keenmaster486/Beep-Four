SPECIAL NOTE: The "input" function (used for manual tile info, doors, etc)
doesn't allow you to use the "backspace" key. All backspace does is erase
the entire value you just entered, except it doesn't erase it from the
screen (DOH!). Just a bug I have to fix but you should be aware of it anyway.
So you can use backspace but it erases the entire value instead of just one
digit, and the next thing you type gets drawn over the old numbers.
