; AdPlay/DOS initialization file
;
; This file is organized in sections (enclosed in []-brackets) and
; subsections (enclosed in ()-brackets). All options are "variable = value"
; pairs.
;
; A section is what is selectable in the application. It represents a
; configuration fraction. Sections can reference other sections.
;
; A subsection is generally used to set options for a specific window inside
; the application. These subsections are named accordingly.
;
; The following subsections are available:
; titlebar	Title bar Window
; infownd	Help/Song Message Window
; songwnd	Song Info Window
; instwnd	Instruments Window
; filesel	File Selector Window
; volbars	Volume Bars Window
; mastervol	Master Volume Window
;
; Option value types are:
; <string> is any string, processed raw up to the end of the line.
; <boolean> is a boolean value. "True" or "Yes" represent a true logical value,
; any other value represents a false logical value.
; <integer> is any integral value (negative or positive).
; <uint> is any positive integral value.
; <char> is a single character.
;
; Integral values can be specified as decimal, hexadecimal or octal numbers.
; To specify a hexadecimal number, prefix it with 0x. To specify an octal number,
; prefix it with 0. Any other value is interpreted as decimal.

; The section named "Default" is always loaded at startup and has to be
; specified once in each initialization file.
[Default]
; Additionally load the sections "HighRes" and "Color", for a high resolution,
; colorful experience. ;)
